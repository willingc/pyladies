Title: About

We are\...
----------

\...a group of women developers worldwide who love the Python
programming language. We write code by day or night. Some of us hack on
Python projects on the side, while others work full-time on Python
development. But it doesn\'t matter. We all just like writing Python
code, and that\'s what brings us together.

### Please join us!

Are you an experienced female Python developer? Or are you new and need
help getting into Python development?

us participate in as well, but let\'s keep this group primarily focused
on Python programming.
